7. Researchers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), NASA, discovered a new radiation-resistant bacteria in 2017 and named it ‘Solibacillus Kalamii’ to honour the late President.
<br>
<br>
8. Kalam was known as the ‘Missile Man’ of India due to his continued, successful work with ballistic missiles and launch vehicle technology. Here are the reasons:
<br>
<br>

* He was the Project Director of India’s first satellite Rohini.
    <br>

-he led to the formation of BrahMos Aerospace between Russia and India.
<br>
<br>
9. Kalam also made significant contributions to the nuclear capabilities of India. The Pokhran -2 nuclear tests (in 1998) were successful thanks to his organizational and technical support.
<br>
<br>
10. Throughout his life, he supported the abolition of the death penalty saying that as President of India he felt pain in deciding mercy petitions of death row convicts.
<br>
<br>
Kalam, the youth icon, wanted every student of the country to be educated and then go on to help the nation grow. He regularly interacted with students of all age and his death too came while he was at it. He passed away due to an unfortunate cardiac arrest minutes after delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong on May 27 2015.</p>
